          %p
            This page contains information supplementary to our main
            organisational privacy policy. It specifically relates to the
            beneficial ownership information we collect and publish as part of
            the Open Ownership Register.
          %p
            It serves to inform data subjects about the uses of their personal information
            and their data protection rights in circumstances where providing privacy information
            directly to the data subjects is disproportionate to the processing of this information.
          %p
            Please refer to our <a href="https://www.openownership.org/privacy/">
            main privacy policy</a> for details of cookies, data
            processors, security and contact details of our Data Protection
            representative.
          %h2{ id: 'personal-information' } Personal Information
          %p
            We obtain beneficial ownership information from official sources of
            corporate information. These sources include, but are not limited to:
          %ul
            %li
              The UK’s Persons of Significant Control (PSC) Register
            %li
              Denmark Central Business Register (CVR)
            %li
              Slovakia Public Sector Partners Register
            %li
              Ukraine Unified States Register (EDR)
          %p
            For a full list of our sources see 
            %a{ href: "/faq" }
              our FAQ.
          %p
            The information that we collect will vary from territory to
            territory depending on the information contained on the official
            public record for that territory. In addition to an individual’s
            name, it is common for the official public record to contain:
          %ul
            %li
              an official address for that individual (not least to ensure that
              legal redress can be obtained); and
            %li
              other information about that individual, including nationality,
              date of birth and occasionally occupation..
          %p
            As reflected above, we aim to be completely open and transparent about
            the source of information we collect and wherever possible we publish a link to
            the source of the data we have collected.

          %h3 Reasons we can collect and use your personal information
          %p
            We collect, store, use and make
            %a{ href: "https://standard.openownership.org/en/latest/schema/schema-browser.html#schema-browser-person" }
              personal information
            available in order to further our journalistic mission - namely,
            making information about the ownership of corporations available to
            the public.

          %h3 Publishing for journalistic purposes
          %p
            In the vast majority of cases, the personal information we collect has been made
            public by the data subject themselves through the submission of such information
            to a public register.
          %p
            For onward processing, we rely on the exemptions which derive from
            %a{ href: "https://gdpr-info.eu/art-85-gdpr/" }
              Article 85 (2) of the General Data Protection Regulation
            , which covers processing for journalistic purposes and exempts us
            from the need to specify a lawful basis for that processing.
          %p
            The processing of beneficial ownership data and related personal
            information in the Open Ownership Register is vital to reducing
            corruption and tax evasion, giving fairer development opportunities,
            building societal trust, and enhancing corporate transparency.

          %h3 How we use your personal information and who can access it
          %p
            We publish your information on our website under the name of the
            company or companies with which you are associated in our database.
            Anyone who has access to the web may be able to access that website
            and obtain copies of the information about you.

          %p
            In addition to public access, we use some third-party data
            processors to help us run this website and share data with them.
            They are listed in the main Open Ownership Privacy policy.

          %h3 How long your personal information will be kept
          %p
            The information we collect forms part of our historical beneficial
            ownership information register.
          %p
            Maintaining this on an on-going basis is fundamental to our
            information mission, and is particularly important for those using
            our services for journalistic purposes. Matters requiring the
            availability of beneficial ownership data may arise for many years
            after a company has ceased to exist.
          %p
            We keep information about the beneficial owners for the lifetime of
            the company, and 20 years after its dissolution. This includes
            details of historical beneficial owners and also applies to dormant
            companies.

          %h2{ id: 'your-rights' } Your rights
          %p
            %a{ href: "https://gdpr-info.eu/art-85-gdpr/" }
              Article 85 of the General Data Protection Regulation
            related to processing for journalistic purposes provides an
            exception to most rights listed under
            %a{ href: "https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-3/" }
              Chapter 3 (Rights of the data subject).
            For the beneficial ownership information we hold, your rights
            include:
          %ul
            %li
              The right to fair processing of your information and transparency
              over how we use your personal information; and
            %li
              The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (see
              How to complain below).
          %p
            To ensure that our collection and processing of your information is
            fair, we also give you the right to:
          %ul
            %li
              obtain any information as to the source(s) of information that we
              hold about you;
            %li access personal information that we hold about you; and
            %li
              require us to correct any mistakes in information we hold about
              you;
          %p
            Note that our journalistic mission related to beneficial ownership
            information means that an individual's request to have
            information about them erased will be subject to the application of
            the journalistic exemption (see Redacting information below).

          %h3 How to contact us
          %p
            If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please:
          %ul
            %li
              send a request to
              %a{ href: 'mailto:support@openownership.org' }
                support@openownership.org
              with the subject line: Privacy Request
            %li
              let us have enough information to identify you; if there is any
              ambiguity about which person you are – for example where several
              people have the same name – please supply enough information for
              us to understand who you are.
            %li
              let us have proof of your identity and address (a copy of your
              driving licence or passport and a recent utility or credit card
              bill), and
            %li
              let us know the information to which your request relates (for
              example: which page on our website displays it?)

          %h2{ id: 'redaction' } Redacting information
          %p
            If we are informed that a public company register has removed (or
            limited access to) certain information about a person concerned with
            a company due to exceptional circumstances (for example, because of
            a serious risk to personal safety), we will take steps to promptly:
          %ul
            %li update the Open Ownership records in a timely manner; and
            %li
              institute a procedure for temporarily removing the relevant
              information from the OpenOwnership records while this is being
              carried out.
          %p
            In keeping with our public mission to support freedom of
            information, we will normally only redact information when a company
            register has redacted it due to exceptional circumstances (such as a
            serious risk to personal safety).
          %p
            You can inform us of any application made to a public company
            register to remove or limit access to your information by
            contacting us (see above, How to contact us). Your request should
            contain full details of the reasons for requesting such removal or
            limitation. Note that requests for redaction of personal information
            must be made by the individual concerned or their legal
            representatives (including in the case of minors, their parents or
            guardians) and we will require proof of ID.

          %h2{ id: 'transfer-out-of-eea' } Transfer of your information out of the EEA
          %p
            The nature of a web-based service means that information will be
            available to persons all over the world. Whilst OpenOwnership does
            not routinely transfer the information it holds outside the EEA, it
            is possible for the information contained in the OpenOwnership
            database to be accessed from anywhere in the world. Making such
            information available to all without restriction is consistent with
            our journalistic mission.

          %h2{ id: 'how-to-complain' } How to complain
          %p
            You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information
            Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK regulator for data protection issues
            (www.ico.org.uk) or your national EU Data Protection Authority. We would,
            however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you
            approach the ICO or relevant Data Protection Authority, so please contact
            us in the first instance.
